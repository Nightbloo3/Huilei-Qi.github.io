<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Currently I am an undergraduate student in the College of Foreign Languages at Ocean University of China. I will soon go to Fudan University to pursue my master’s degree in Applied Linguistics. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yingying Liu](https://flc.ouc.edu.cn/2021/1022/c12471a353865/page.htm) during my undergraduate years. My research interests include second language acquisition, complex dynamics system theory, English for Academic Purposes, and technology-enhanced language learning. I am particularly interested in examining second language development (especially L2 writing) by means of a corpus-based approach. I also have a longstanding interest in computer-assisted language learning, such as how Large Language Models can be employed to improve learning efficiency. My work appears in _System_ and _Applied Linguistics_.
