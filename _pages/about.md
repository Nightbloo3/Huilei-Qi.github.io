<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Currently I am an undergraduate student in the College of Foreign Languages at Ocean University of China. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yingying Liu](https://flc.ouc.edu.cn/2021/1022/c12471a353865/page.htm) during my undergraduate years. Starting in August 2024, I am scheduled to commence my master's degree in Applied Linguistics at Fudan University.<br> <br> My research interests are primarily in second language acquisition, Complex DDynamics System Theory, corpus linguistics, English for Academic Purposes, and technology-enhanced language learning. I am particularly interested in examining second language development (especially L2 writing) by means of a corpus-based approach. My impetus for pursuing this research direction comes from my personal experiences that I struggled for a prolonged time to promote my writing skills, and I therefore find this line of research particularly useful for L2 acquisition and pedagogy. I also have a longstanding interest in computer-assisted language learning, such as how Large Language Models(LLMs) can be employed in language learning, teaching and assessment. My work appears in _System_ and _Applied Linguistics_.<br>
